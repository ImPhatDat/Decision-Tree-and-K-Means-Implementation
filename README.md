# Decision-Tree-and-K-Nearest-Neighbors-implementation

## Course: CSC14004 - DATA MINING AND APPLICATIONS

This is a course work from the Data Mining and Applications course, in which I implement and experiment with a simple classification algorithm (__Decision Tree__) and a basic clustering algorithm (__K-Nearest-Neighbors__). Then, using this algorithm to help analyze and get useful insights from the Dataset. Finally, compare the different between those 2 algorithms.
